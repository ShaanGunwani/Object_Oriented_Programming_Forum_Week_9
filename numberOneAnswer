A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects that define a set of attributes (data) and methods (behaviors). It defines a common structure and behavior that objects of that class will have. An instantiation of a class, also known as an object, is a specific instance of that class created using the class definition. It has its own set of attributes and can perform the methods defined by the class.
For example, in the scenario given, the class "Product" can be defined to have attributes such as product name, price, and quantity, and methods such as selling and restocking. An instantiation of this class could be a specific product, such as "iPhone 12" with a price of $1000 and a quantity of 50.
